# ClanRankSystem

This is the Rank System which my Runescape3 Clan uses to keep track of promotions based on a user's total level,
date in which they joined the clan, and whether or not they are in our Discord. 

Future changes will include access to a MongoDB database to better keep track of the data and parse through it
quicker.

NOTE: an example data spread is provided using my clan's most recent data (File: TNC_Data.txt). Whenever a player is not up for promotion,
"N/A" is printed instead.
